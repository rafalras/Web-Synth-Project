Hi again and long time no see, convolution world!

These are the first impulses I have made for ReaVerb, the included convo plug for the incredible, revolutionary, REAPER DAW. If you havent tried it yet, get over to reaper.fm and take the few seconds to download and setup this 2 meg app. Its got everything a computer hating tape-head could ever want if they built their own DAW...the greatest routing - EVER


Have fun!
